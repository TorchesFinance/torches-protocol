Enzo Protocol
=================

The Enzo Protocol is an decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol based on Bitlayer, where users, wallets and dapps can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralised manner.
